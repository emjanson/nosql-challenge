# nosql-challenge
MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 12 Challenge

Code files: NoSQL_setup_starter_complete.ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter_complete.ipynb

This repository contains two core files: 1. a Jupyter Notebook based import and update task to a MongoDB database which contains information about restaurants within the UK, and 2. a Jupyter Notebook/panads/MongoDB based exploratory data analysis of said restaurants based on criteria requested by an imaginary client using the restaurant database we created in the first Notebook. This Notebook establishes a MongoDB database, imports a JSON of restaurants into the database, adds a document to the collection within the database, and performs a series of simple exploratory data analyses about the restaurants in the database.

Code sourcing statement
-----------------------
I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this particular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
-----------------------

The repository also contains a directory called 'Resources' which contains the JSON we used to import into our MongoDB database.
